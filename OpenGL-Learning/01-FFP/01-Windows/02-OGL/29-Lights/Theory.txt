Let there be Light - Bible

Tamasomay Jyotirgamay

Ambient Light -> That light that scattered from surface, light source and direction is not definable (If sun not visible at sunset but scattering light) Feeling is ambient
Diffused Light-> That light that its source and direction is definable  (Sun Light), visible is diffused
Specular Light -> As light diffused light, source and direction is known, but it bounce off from surface and enters into eyes (Shiny material). Its always white or grey
Emusive Light -> When material it self beomes source of light its emusive light

Color intensity is decided by diffused light

//Steps of lighting
Step1: Give Normals to the surfacs/object surfaces to which we are giing to lit
		Normals give detauls of orientation of surface
		Per vertex, Per premitive, per fragment, per surface, Per patch
		Normals must be unit vector. if not in unit length then lighting becomes ugly and patchy. 
		To do this there are 2 ways in FFP
			a) Enable GL_NORMALIZE OR --> It checks whether vecor is unit vector if not then it convert to unit length
			b) Enable GL_RESCALE_NORMAL --> 
		glNormal*()			
			
Step2: Decide source of light, type of light, properties of light and enable accordingly and also enable global lighting
		FFP OpenGL supports 8 lights -> GL_LIGHT0 to GL_LIGHT7
		By default GL_LIGHT0 is enables thats why even though without lighting objects were visible.
		There are about 10 imp properties of light. glLighfv()
			GL_DIFFSED, GL_AMBIENT, GL_POSITION, GL_SPECULAR, 
			Spotlight related: GL_SPOT_CUTOFF, GL_SPOT_DIRECTION, GL_SPOT_EXPONENT
			Attenuation: GL_CONSTANT_ATTENUATION, GL_LINEAR_ATTENUATION, GL_QUADRATIC_ATTENUATION
		By default Light0's GL_DIFFUSED & GL_SPECULAR are white. Other lights is black. GL_AMBIENT of all lights is black
		Enabling light only is not enough. There is global lighting switch which has to enable to enable all default lighting.(GL_LIGHTING)
		
Step3: Decide lighting model
		We useally no need to use this step because default lighting model does things well.
		There are 4 points to be considered for lighting
		a) Whether to consider outer surface or inner surface or both - GL_LIGHT_MODEL_TWO_SIDED. By default lighting model is not 2 sided
		b) Whether to consider global ambient light or not. THis is specified by GL_LIGHT_MODEL_AMBIENT. By default global light is considered.
		c) Whether to consider position of the viewer, By default OpenGL assumes viewer is infinitely away and looking into screen.
			GL_LIGHT_MODEL_LOCAL_VIEWER
		d) Whether to consider specular light as part of ambinet light or diffused light or not & Specular light to be considered before texturing ot after texturing
			GL_LIGHT_MODEL_COLOR_CONTROL
		glLightModels*()

Step4: Specify material property
		While considering material 2 things needs to considered
			a) on which surface material is applied on front / back or both. By default front face is considered
				GL_FRONT, FL_BACK, GL_FRONT_AND_BACK
			b) 7 Properties of material
				GL_DIFFSED, GL_AMBIENT, GL_SPECULAR, GL_SHININESS, GL_AMBIENT_AND_DIFFUSE, GL_EMISSION, GL_COLOR_INDEXES
			glMaterial*()
		
#	OpenGL considers 2 types of lights according to positions. Both have same option GL_POSITION
		a) Directional light: Sunlight. 
			In direction Light is assumed to be positioned at infinite. It is specified 4th member in position array as '0'
		b) Positional light: Table Lamp.
			Location of positional light is not infinite. Specify 4th member of position array as '1'.
		
#	What is significance last member of ambient, specular & diffused array.
		It has no meaning whether 0 / 1 until blending is enabled.

Sir, Maaf kara chukat asel tr, Unit normal vector ghetal nai tr, normal vector chi magnitude light intensity sobat multiply houn patches yetil mhanun. 
Ajun ek karan asa asel ki, material light chi direction hi normal vector ni milel. Unit length mule material light intensity change honar nai.
